# Custom usage of ULTRA

This repo is a fork from [ULTRA](https://github.com/kit-algo/ULTRA/), developed at [KIT](https://www.kit.edu) in the [group of Prof. Dorothea Wagner](https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/).

It contains custom code that :

- builds the binary data needed by ULTRA from some public GTFS/OSM data
- runs the preprocessing phase of ULTRA
- wraps the query phase of ULTRA in a basic http server
- provides a basic web-based viewer, that is a client to the http server

The code in this repo is for exploration/testing purposes. For lots of reasons, it is absolutely not suitable for anything remotely close to production.

NOTE 2021-04-30 : this repo was moved and will not be updated.
