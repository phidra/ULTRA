# Custom usage of ULTRA

This repo is a fork from [ULTRA](https://github.com/kit-algo/ULTRA/), developed at [KIT](https://www.kit.edu) in the [group of Prof. Dorothea Wagner](https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/).

It contains custom code that :

- STEP 1 = builds the binary data needed by ULTRA from some public GTFS/OSM data
- STEP 2 = runs the preprocessing phase of ULTRA
- STEP 3 = wraps the query phase of ULTRA in a basic http server
- STEP 4 = provides a basic web-based viewer, that is a client to the http server
